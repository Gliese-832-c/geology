## Geology

Geology is a mod that adds a large variety of real life rocks and minerals to the game. This includes all the types of rocks (volcanic, plutonic, sedimentary, and metamorphic), as well as the most common minerals used to obtain each of the chemical elements. The mod does not come with any worldgen or crafting recipes, as it's intended to be used by pack authors who will spawn the blocks in using mods such as Cave Generator, Realistic Ore Veins, and CoFH World that provide the ability to create custom scripts to modify the game's world generation.
